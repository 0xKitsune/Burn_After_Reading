# Burn_After_Reading

A Rust based program that destroys a message after the message is opened.



Notes:
When a user runs bar init or something, it creates a directory called "burn_after_reading". Then you can put anything into that folder that you want. Once the folder is opened and closed, it destroys everything in the folder.
