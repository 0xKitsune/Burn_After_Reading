# Burn_After_Reading

A Rust based program that destroys a message after the message is opened.



Notes:
When a user runs bar init or something, it creates a directory called "burn_after_reading". Then you can put anything into that folder that you want. After filling the folder, you can press enter and a Rust binary will be made, which can be sent to someone. After it runs, it will recreate the files and the folder and the user can explore the files, after exploring, the user can close the program and it will destroy anything titled burn_after_reading on the computer.
